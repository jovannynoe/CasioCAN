 * @brief   This file is the LCD driver.
 *
 * The driver was made with many functions to every thing to do, we have a function to initialize the LCD,
 * to send a command through SPI, to send a data and string through SPI, to set the cursor in the LCD, to
 * turn on or turn off the light and to set the contrast of 0 to 15 like you want.
 * 
 * @note    We need take in count that this driver is just to use the functions in another source file to
 * can print in the LCD some information. Also, you need configurate the SPI in another file when you want
 * use the functions and this driver was made only to SPI, not works with I2C or another peripheral.
